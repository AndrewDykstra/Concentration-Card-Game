# Concentration-Card-Game
Concentration card game recreated using Java

This was my final project for Fundamentals of Computer Science 2 in my 2nd Semester of Freshman Year at Northeastern University. I added additional features to the game which includes a timer, move counter, a mamimum move amount which adds a losing factor to the game, and a victory screen after identifying all of the pairs within the set maximum move count.
